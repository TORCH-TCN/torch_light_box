# TORCH Light Box - Open source design for imaging natural history collections
The TORCH Light Box design follows the basic design and features of existing light boxes that are used for imaging herbarium specimens but can be built at a low cost, with parts and materials that are readily available using basic tools and skills to fabricate. Secondary goals of the design were to facilitate rapid prototyping with components that were easy to adapt, reconfigure, and customize and a design that can be assembled and disassembled for shipping to other herbaria using roving imaging stations. The specimen platform measures 23” x 17” and includes an integrated plastic guide to facilitate positioning of the specimen for imaging and an integrated camera stand allows a digital camera to be mounted and aimed through a hole in the top panel of the box.
